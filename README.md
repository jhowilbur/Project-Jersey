# Little project to expose my knowledge
## this project is a WEB SERVICE example
### this project are building in a Jersey

The REST (Representational State Transfer) standard is increasingly becoming a standard for sharing information on web services. Created in 2000, this standard uses the concept of resources that are identified by global ids and uses the methods specific to the HTTP protocol to perform operations on these resources on a Web server. For example, the GET method obtains a resource or a list of them, while PUT inserts, POST updates and DELETE removes. Another interesting feature of REST is that we can assign it by the type of return of the service, it can be: XML, JSON, ATOM, etc.

To establish a standard for making Web Services available using RESTful, JSR-311 was created, and its reference implementation is Jersey, developed by Sun (I miss you :) that I used in this project.

The following components are part of Jersey:

- Core Server: For building RESTful services based on annotation (jersey-core, jersey-server, jsr311-api)
- Core Client: Aids you in communicating with REST services (jersey-client)
- JAXB support
- JSON support
- Integration module for Spring and Guice
